# Pytest

- pytest recognizes test functions that have the `test` prefix or postfix in their name. So, a function `test_function` or `function_test` will be recognized as test function
- pytest fixtures provide a reusable code. For example, to set up the environment for each test.
- to use a fixture in a test, provide the fixture name as an argument to the `test` function.
- to see all pytest output (including `print` staements in test), you have to run `pytest -s` in terminal or use the "debug testing" in vs code

# Playwright

- playwright has automatic waiting mechanism, so there shouldn't be a need to manually manage async code
